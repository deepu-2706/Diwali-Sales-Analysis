Diwali Sales Analysis
For a Diwali Sales analysis, you would typically aim to understand patterns and trends in sales data related to the Diwali festival. Here's a structured approach to analyzing Diwali sales data and what each part entails:

1. Objective of Analysis
Determine what you want to learn from the data. Common objectives for Diwali sales analysis include:

Identifying sales trends and patterns during Diwali.
Understanding customer purchasing behavior.
Analyzing the performance of different products or categories.
Evaluating the impact of promotions and discounts.
2. Data Overview
Columns:

User_ID: Unique identifier for customers.
Cust_name: Customer names (may not be used for analysis but for identification).
Product_ID: Unique identifier for products.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age Group: Age group category of the customer.
Age: Exact age of the customer.
Marital_Status: Marital status of the customer.
State: State where the customer resides.
Zone: Geographical zone.
Occupation: Occupation of the customer.
Product_Category: Category of the product purchased.
Orders: Number of orders placed.
Amount: Total amount spent on purchases.
Status: Could be a categorical status like 'Completed', 'Pending', etc.
unnamed1: Additional column, possibly irrelevant or used for other purposes.
3. Data Cleaning
Handle Missing Values: Fill or impute missing values in important columns. For example, if Status has many missing values, decide whether to fill them with a default value or use another imputation method.
Remove Unnecessary Columns: Drop columns that do not add value to the analysis, such as Cust_name if it is not useful.
Data Type Conversion: Ensure data types are correct (e.g., Amount should be numeric).
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Analyze the central tendency and dispersion (mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation) for numerical columns like Amount and Orders.
Distribution: Plot histograms or density plots for Age, Orders, Amount to understand their distributions.
Categorical Analysis: Analyze frequencies and distributions for categorical variables like Gender, Product_Category, Marital_Status.
Bivariate Analysis
Correlation Analysis: Examine relationships between numerical variables, e.g., correlation between Age and Amount.
Group Analysis: Analyze how Amount varies with Product_Category or State. For instance, average sales per state or category.
Comparative Analysis: Compare sales data before and during Diwali. Plot line charts to visualize trends over time.
Multivariate Analysis
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduce dimensionality of data to identify underlying patterns.
Clustering: Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) to group similar customers or products.
Feature Importance: Use models like Random Forest to identify the most important features affecting sales.
5. Feature Engineering
Create New Features: Based on existing data, such as:
Customer Segments: Define segments like ‘High Spend’, ‘Frequent Buyer’.
Seasonal Features: Extract features related to the Diwali period (e.g., Days Until Diwali).
Aggregated Features: Calculate features like average Amount spent per Product_Category.
6. Data Visualization
Trend Analysis: Use line plots to show sales trends over time.
Distribution Plots: Box plots or violin plots to show distribution of Amount across different Product_Category.
Geographical Analysis: Heatmaps to show sales distribution across different states or zones.
7. Modeling (if applicable)
Predictive Modeling: If predicting future sales or customer behavior, choose appropriate models (e.g., regression models, time series forecasting).
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE for regression or accuracy, F1 score for classification.
8. Insights and Recommendations
Summarize Findings: Provide a summary of key insights from the analysis, such as peak sales periods, high-performing product categories, or customer segments.
Actionable Recommendations: Suggest actions based on findings, like targeted promotions, inventory adjustments, or marketing strategies for future Diwali sales.
